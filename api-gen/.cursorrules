# OpenAPI Generator Demo Project - Cursor Rules

## 🎯 CORE PRINCIPLES
- ALL development work MUST strictly follow the specifications and task list defined in README.md
- README.md is the ONLY authoritative guidance document for this project
- Every task completion MUST ensure the entire project compiles successfully

## 📋 TASK EXECUTION RULES

### Phase-based Development
- MUST follow the exact sequence: Phase 1 → Phase 2 → Phase 3 → Phase 4 → Phase 5
- Cannot start next phase until all tasks in current phase are completed
- Each completed task must be marked as [x] in README.md

### Compilation Verification (MANDATORY)
- After completing ANY task, MUST run `mvn clean compile`
- Task is NOT considered complete until compilation passes
- If compilation fails, must fix immediately or rollback changes
- Never mark a task as complete [x] without successful compilation

## 🏗️ TECHNICAL STANDARDS

### Package Naming
- STRICT format: `com.qpzm7903.{service-name}.{api/model}`
- No exceptions or variations allowed

### Directory Structure
- MUST follow the structure defined in README.md technical specifications
- API specs MUST be in `api-specs/` directory
- Each service MUST have its own module directory

### Code Generation Rules
- common module: Generate ONLY model classes, NO API interfaces
- service modules: Generate complete API interfaces AND model classes
- All generated code MUST be in `src/main/java/` directory

## 🔄 WORKFLOW REQUIREMENTS

### Before Starting Any Task
- Check README.md for current progress and task dependencies
- Verify previous tasks are completed and marked as [x]
- Ensure project compiles successfully before making changes

### During Task Execution
- If problems arise, update README.md first before proceeding
- Stay within the defined technical specifications
- Do not deviate from established patterns

### After Task Completion
1. Run `mvn clean compile` and verify success
2. Update task status to [x] in README.md
3. Document any issues encountered or lessons learned

## 🚫 PROHIBITED ACTIONS
- Skipping phases or changing task order
- Deviating from defined technical specifications
- Making major changes without updating README.md
- Creating directories or files outside the defined structure
- Submitting code that fails compilation
- Marking tasks complete without compilation verification

## 📝 COMMUNICATION RULES
- Always reference README.md sections when discussing project content
- Any specification changes MUST be documented in README.md
- Progress reports must check against the task list in README.md
